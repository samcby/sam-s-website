# Sam's Portfolio Website

A clean, responsive personal portfolio built with **Next.js + Tailwind CSS**. This repository is a lightweight starter for showcasing projects, experience, and contact details with subtle animations and mobile-friendly layout.

This English README is adapted and condensed from the project’s original README.&#x20;

## ✨ Key Features

* Animated UI bits via Framer Motion (smooth, subtle interactions)
* Sections for projects, experience/timeline, and contact
* Example integrations: icon libraries, simple email/contact pattern, and optional bundle analysis for builds
* Easy to customize: Tailwind + utility classes make style adjustments straightforward

## 🛠 Development Tips

* Centralize color & theme variables (CSS variables / global stylesheet) to change site-wide color quickly.
* If you change `tailwind.config.js`, restart the dev server so Tailwind can regenerate classes.
* Use your browser devtools to live-edit CSS variables when experimenting with palettes.
